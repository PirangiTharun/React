create-react-app uses Webpack!.

npm install -D parcel (-D is a command for dev dependency. Not applicable for production)
And this command is equivalent to npm install --save-dev parcel

"devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.8.2"
}

"^version" -> states that it will auto upgrade to minor version changes like 2.8.3
"version"  -> It will keep the specified version only
"~version" -> It will auto upgrade to major version changes like 3.0.0
